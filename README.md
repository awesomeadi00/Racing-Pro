## Game Elements: 
In this racing game, we have several elements: 
1. We have 3 vehicles to choose from (each having their own specific stats to them):
      - Red Car
      - Blue Car
      - Special Car: This car can only be unlocked by finding a secret token hidden somewhere within the game.

2. We have two circuits from which the user can choose from:
     - One at nightime
     - One at sunset 

3. The circuits are located on mountainous terrain with some urban parts.

4. The game presents a main menu screen from which the user can select either one of the cars and circuits available.

5. The race consists of completing 3 laps, and will only finish after the 3rd lap.

6. The race is time based, meaning you must complete all three laps as quickly as possible. The faster the better your score and higher your rating.
  
7. The game presents a HUD where you can see:
     - Your speed (through a spedometer)
     - Your lap count (how many laps you've completed.
     - Your current lap time
     - Your total race time for all 3 laps
       
8. The game includes several sounds of the environment, SFX and background game music as well for enhancing the overall experience.

9. If the player wishes to restart or return to the main menu, the option to press 'P' at anytime is always available.

## Improvements: 
1. One improvement could be to display the statistics for each car to see what the difference could be between each of them.

2. Another improvement could be to add shortcuts to enhance the overall racing experience.

3. Borders could also be added to the track to ensure the racer doesn't always fall off the track which can be annoying, especially on mountanious terrain.

4. Add replay animations when the race ends for more formality. 

5. Apply some damage to the car after crashes to enhance the realism of the racing game.
